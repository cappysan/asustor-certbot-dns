## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The APK application is available as a GitLab release, and on [https://asustor.cappysan.dev/](https://asustor.cappysan.dev/)

The APK application is not available as an Asustor App Central application as Asustor does not accept duplicates nor applications without a UI.


### Usage

A brief usage guide can be found below. A more complete step-by-step guide is available on [https://blog.cappysan.dev](https://blog.cappysan.dev) in the Asustor section.


### Application Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- Download the APK file from Cappysan's Asustor website ([https://asustor.cappysan.dev/2025/12/03/certbot](https://asustor.cappysan.dev/2025/12/03/certbot)  
- Install the package
- Configure the share folder "Configuration" permissions to prevent anonymous access and to protect files.
- Edit files "provider.conf", "credentials.conf" and "domains.conf" (via File Explorer, SSH or a shared folder mount)
- If a file "<provider>.conf" exists, it will be used and "credentials.conf" will be ignored.
- If a file "cmdline.conf" exists, it will be used instead of the autogenerated commandline.
- Restart the certbot application.
