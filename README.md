## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The APK application is available as a GitLab release, and on [https://asustor.cappysan.dev/](https://asustor.cappysan.dev/)

The APK application is not available as an Asustor App Central application as Asustor does not accept duplicates nor applications without a UI.


### Usage

A brief usage guide can be found below. A more complete step-by-step guide is available on [https://blog.cappysan.dev](https://blog.cappysan.dev) in the Asustor section.


### Application Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- Install the package
- A share folder named "Configuration" will be created. Configure it to only enable admins in read-write mode. Deny anonymous and user access.
- Ensure you can modify files in the "Configuration/cerbot" with either SSH, a mount point, or the Asustor File Explorer.
- In the "cerbot" folder, edit "domains.conf" with the domains to get a cert for. eg: "\*.example.com"
- In the "cerbot" folder, edit "provider.conf" with the name of DNS validator you will use.
- In the "cerbot" folder, edit "credentials.conf" or "<provider>.conf"with credentials you will use. 
- An optional "<provider>.cmdline.conf" file can be created to override the DNS specific certbot command line.
- De-activate and re-activate the application to generate the certificates;
- Verify in the builtin syslog viewer on the NAS interface that certificate generation was a success, or not.
- Download the "certificates.zip" from the certbot configuration folder,
- Add those certificates to the Certificate Manager.
